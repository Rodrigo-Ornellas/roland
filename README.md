Python/Django: Analyzing Roland Printer's peck (log) files for Technical Support Team

### INTRO >
This is a personal and individual project.
I have worked reparing Roland Printers in the past. (https://www.rolanddga.com/)
It is possible to generate a text log file that show many details about the printer operation and status.

### DETAILS >
In this project, I am working to parse these log files (using Python), store them a database of printers and customers on a web based platform (using Django/SQLite during development).

** WARNING **
The project is under development. The project is not currently working because I decided to use a newer Django version.
I still need to make the necessary adjustments in the code. The upgrade and a few other changes I made have bugged the systm.

### PHASE 2 (to be started) >
Generate graphs and some statistics about the printers.
